# Bash

## macOS

With this OS, these three bash dotfiles have slightly different purposes.

TLDR; the `.bash_profile` and `.profile` files are only loaded when you log into the shell and they are for interactive shell configuration. The `.bashrc` file is loaded whenever you spin up a subshell or a non-interactive shell, but is also configured to always load at login.
